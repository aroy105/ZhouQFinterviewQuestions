Given two ropes of varying densities at different points (i.e. different burn times through different sections) which burn completely in 1 hour, how do you use these two ropes to measure 45 minutes? 

This problem really made me feel super inadquate. I guess it really made me recognize just how uncreative I am. 

Solution:
If a rope takes x minutes to burn from one side to another, it will take x/2 minutes to burn if you simulataneously set it on fire from both ends. 

If we light one rope from both ends and the other rope normally, after 30 minutes, the first will be completely burnt out, while the other one will have become a 30 minute rope. 

Right when the first rope is burnt out, we should know light the second, now 30-min rope from the unburnt end. 

Thus the second rope should burn out 15 minutes, for a grand total of 45 minutes after the first match was lit. s

Maybe a possible thing to notice was the x/2 nature, and also notice that 45 mins is 1.5x 30 mins.
