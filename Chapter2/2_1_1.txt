Screwy Pirates 
Question:
How will the 100 gold coins be divided among five democratic pirates who follow a specific voting process and prioritize staying alive and acquiring more gold while minimizing the number of pirates on the boat?
The senior pirate proposes a plan, and if at least 50% of the pirates agree to the plan, the coins will be divided. If not, then the senior pirate will be killed, and the process continues with the second most senior pirate. 


Answer: 
We should use Game Theory/DP to solve this question. Try a smaller # of pirates

The 1-pirate case is trivial. The 2-pirate case will result in the senior pirate getting all the gold since he represents 50% of the pirates and can thus take all the money he wants 

If we add a third pirate, then what happens? Well, everyone knows that if he (pirate 3) gets killed, pirate 2 gets everything and pirate 1 gets nothing.
Thus, he can propose 1 coin to pirate 1, 0 coins to pirate 2, and 99 coins to himself. Pirate 1 will agree since this is one more than he'd get if he votes to kill pirate 3. 

If we add a fourth pirate, then what happens? As we saw in the third case, we know that pirate 2 will get nothing amongst rational pirates. Thus, to get 50% aggreement, pirate 4 will offer pirate 2 one coin, while keeping 99 for himself. 

But what if we finally get to our 5 pirate case? If he gets killed, then Pirates 1 and 3 get nothing. Thus, he should offer Pirates 2 and 4 nothing, and he should offer Pirates 1 and 3 one coin each, while keeping 98 coins for himself. 

To generalize this, it becomes clear that for any 2n + 1 pirate cases (for n < 99), the senior pirate will get all the coins after distributing 1 coin to pirates 1, 3, ... , 2n - 1 each.
