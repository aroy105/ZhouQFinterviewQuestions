100 tigers and 100 sheep are put on a magic island that only has grass. Tigers can eat grass but would rather eat sheep. Assume:
A) Each time, only one tiger can eat one sheep, and the tiger will itself become a sheep after it eats the sheep. 
B) All tigers are smart and perfectly rational and they want to survive. 
Will the sheep be eaten? 

Solution. 
Similar to the pirate problem, break it down to n = 1 tiger. In this case, the sheep gets eaten, 
In n = 2 tigers, the sheep does not get eaten, since if one tiger eats the sheep, it'll degrade to the n = 1 tiger state, and he'll be eaten as well. 
In n = 3 tigers, the first tiger to do the math can safely eat the sheep, because if he does, it'll devolve to the n = 2 state, where neither tiger eats any sheep for fear that they themselves will be eaten 

Thus, if n is even, no tigers will eat the sheep, but if n is odd, the sheep dies.
