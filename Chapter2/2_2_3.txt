A casino offers a card game using a normal deck of 52 cards. The rule is that you tum over two cards each time. 
For each pair, if both are black, they go to the dealer's pile; if both are red, they go to your pile; if one black and one red, they are discarded.
The process is repeated until you two go through all 52 cards. 
If you have more cards in your pile, you win $100; otherwise (including ties) you get nothing. You can negotiate the price you want to pay for the game. 
How much would you be willing to pay to play this game?

Solution: 
In the best case scenario, the board is paired up in such a way where there are 26 black pairs and 26 red pairs i.e. a tie i.e. you lose. 
If we consider permutations where there are pairs, the number of black pairs and the number of red pairs will ALWAYS be the same i.e. you lose. 
There is literally no situation where there are more red pairs than black pairs. Conversely, there are also no situations where there are more black pairs than red, 
but that doesn't really matter. Thus, you should never play this game, because even if there is no charge to play, you waste your time.
